    "As the Black Lives Matter movement swept through the nation over the summer, new questions arose in my high school alumni group chat. While I didn't attend a \"private\" school perse, my high school requires an application and is usually filled with high-income students with very few students of color. Against a more racially and politically charged backdrop, the Facebook group grapped with the issue of how to ensure that our elite magnet school was equitable. Ammendments to admission critera were proposed, as were greater outreach programs and quota systems. However for me, a deeper question lurked in the background: should my elite, priviledged high school--and other schools like it--even exist? "

    "To approach this question, I assemble a dataset of all counties in the United States with information about educational outcomes and the presence of private schools by merging information from the [Stanford Educational Data Archive (Version 4.0)](https://edopportunity.org/get-the-data/seda-archive-downloads/#documentation-4) and [Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data Private Schools](https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/private-schools?geometry=77.758%2C23.941%2C52.270%2C64.949). The Stanford Educational Data Archive (SEDA) provides county level data on achievement of students in public schools broken down by racial, gender, and socioeconomic groups for easy comparison. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data Private Schools dataset (HIFLD) provides a list of all private schools in the United States, with information about their enrollment and which county they belong to. I construct a count of private schools and their students in each county from the HIFLD dataset and merge that with the SEDA dataset to provide information on the presence of private schools in each county."

Since so many counties are missing one value or another, I have decided to leave in the NAs for cleaining. Omitting counties for missing one variable might bias results towards counties with more robust collection methods - or ones that meet criteria for having a certain value (e.g. having enough asian students to report their test scores). For future analyses and summaries, the appropriate counties will be omitted if they are missing the necessary variables, but as a a part of the data cleaning, I will not remove them."
