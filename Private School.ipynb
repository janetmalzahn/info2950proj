    "As the Black Lives Matter movement swept through the nation over the summer, new questions arose in my high school alumni group chat. While I didn't attend a \"private\" school perse, my high school requires an application and is usually filled with high-income students with very few students of color. Against a more racially and politically charged backdrop, the Facebook group grapped with the issue of how to ensure that our elite magnet school was equitable. Ammendments to admission critera were proposed, as were greater outreach programs and quota systems. However for me, a deeper question lurked in the background: should my elite, priviledged high school--and other schools like it--even exist? "

    "To approach this question, I assemble a dataset of all counties in the United States with information about educational outcomes and the presence of private schools by merging information from the [Stanford Educational Data Archive (Version 4.0)](https://edopportunity.org/get-the-data/seda-archive-downloads/#documentation-4) and [Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data Private Schools](https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/private-schools?geometry=77.758%2C23.941%2C52.270%2C64.949). The Stanford Educational Data Archive (SEDA) provides county level data on achievement of students in public schools broken down by racial, gender, and socioeconomic groups for easy comparison. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data Private Schools dataset (HIFLD) provides a list of all private schools in the United States, with information about their enrollment and which county they belong to. I construct a count of private schools and their students in each county from the HIFLD dataset and merge that with the SEDA dataset to provide information on the presence of private schools in each county."

I want to group our data by county and compute some summary statistics to be able to merge it with the SEDA data. Originally, I grouped the data first by COUNTY, COUNTYFIPS, and STATE, but there appeared to be some counties that mistakenly shared FIPS codes. By getting rid of the county names, we confirm that all counties with the same FIPS number will be grouped together. By doing this we go from having 2341 rows to just 2146."

    "4. It seems like there are 15 duplicate FIPS IDs. This means that there is a (supposedly unique) FIPS id matched with a different state. There are two ways to handle this: first, we could just group by countyfips in the previous step rather than by countyfips and state, meaning that schools with the wrong state are grouped to the county their FIPS identifies them as. Second, I could just drop the duplicate county with the lower number of schools. Inspecting the duplicates show that there is usually just one lone private school in the case where there is a different state duplicate. I will drop these 17 duplicate counties since their data in one way or another is corrupted."

Since so many counties are missing one value or another, I have decided to leave in the NAs for cleaining. Omitting counties for missing one variable might bias results towards counties with more robust collection methods - or ones that meet criteria for having a certain value (e.g. having enough asian students to report their test scores). For future analyses and summaries, the appropriate counties will be omitted if they are missing the necessary variables, but as a a part of the data cleaning, I will not remove them."

    "1. At first glance, the names of the counties in the data from SEDA and HIFLD do not match exactly. Luckily, both datasets contain [FIPS county codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_county_code), which uniquely identify counties in the United States. We will merge our data based on these codes. I will use a left merge to maintain counties in the SEDA data that do not have private schools. Additionally, for the long data, this ensures that all the subgroups are kept."

Having the data in both forms enables me to work with it in different ways and select which version best matches whatever analysis or visualization I am trying to do, so I aim to generate two final forms of my dataset: one in long form and one in wide form. The `all_merged_long` dataset is, as the name implies in long form. So now we have to get a version in wide form."
